# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
In this project, I have built a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The main goal is to use a simple logistic regression classifier to classify between cancerous and noncancerous patients.                                                                                                                                                                           
The code is divided into the following tasks:                                                                                                                                                                          
1: Introduction and Import Libraries.                                                                                                                                                                             
2: Download the dataset directly from Kaggle.                                                                                                                                                                     
3: Load and explore the Dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                  
4: Perform LabelEncoding.                                                                                                                                                                                         
5: Split the data into Independent and Dependent sets and perform Feature Scaling.                                                                                                                                
6: Building Logistic Regression Classifier.                                                                                                                                                                       
7: Evaluate the performance of the model.
